***Project**

**The Undergraduateâ€™s Guide To Research Software Engineering** aims to provide an *open-source*, *dynamic*, and *accessible* collection of resources on Research Software Engineering to undergraduates and newcomers interested in knowing more about the field.

The project aims to develop resources majorly around the following four areas:

1. **Information and Background of Research Software Engineering**

* This area would cover all the necessary context, history, background information, and the current situation of the Research Software Engineering movement across the world.

2. **Training and Education Resources**

* This area would cover all the necessary resources and materials to help develop skills required by a Research Software Engineer.
* It would cover existing resources as well as could be expanded to include new material.

3. **Job Board for Entry Level Positions**

* This area would primarily provide entry-level job listings in the field of Research Software Engineering and Open Science to lower the entry barrier for newcomers.

4. **Support and Community Engagement Resources**

* This area would provide support to newcomers in the form of open access community platforms as well as aim to provide help from experts on a case-to-case basis.

***Problem**

Currently, the RSE community has a high entry barrier in terms of employment since most RSE positions require at least a Master's Degree or a PhD, or equivalent experience.

To tackle this problem, there has been a push in the RSE community to open up more entry-level positions. However, there exists a gap between the undergraduate students and the community itself in terms of a number of factors:

* Most undergraduate students are unaware of the RSE movement and are only aware of the typical routes such as typical software development roles, lab research or higher studies.
* A lot of students lack the skill set required in RSE positions since typical software development has different demands.
* There are a lot of existing resources for RSEs, but they can be overwhelming for students since they are designed for the community as a whole rather than newcomers.
* The community has extensive support available, but there is a lack of structure and networks for the students to tap into.

While the above list is non-exhaustive, the project aims to take a step forward in making it easier for students to navigate the Research Software Engineering movement and become a part of it.

***Achievements**

I want to accomplish the following achievements during the OLS program:

* Collaborate successfully with the RSE community to develop the project.
* Develop a working prototype of the project covering all four areas.
* Spread awareness amongst undergraduate students and newcomers about RSE and help them develop the relevant skill set.
* Apply Open Science principles learnt during the program to the project successfully.
* Establish a community of people from all stages and walks of life across the RSE movement, especially one more conducive for newcomers.
* Establish a strong foundation for the project which is open to new contributors and can help develop the project beyond the program itself.
* Engage with different stakeholders in the RSE movement to help lower the entry barriers for newcomers.

***Status**

*   I have a great idea

***Goal**

*   Just launched first prototype

***Open**

There are various reasons that inspire me to work openly in research. A few of them are:

* I believe that through open collaboration, we are able to harness the best resources sustainably.
* The low entry barriers to open research and communities help feel everyone welcome, which was one of the primary reasons I dived into Open Science as a student myself.
* The openness helps everyone to keep their perspective and ideas forward which is a huge advantage as diverse views help build better communities and projects.
* It helps people from marginalised communities to participate and contribute to various areas in open science.
* Open Research helps in using existing resources in the best possible manner rather than reinventing the wheel every time.
* Community engagement and the welcoming culture in open research cultivate the feeling of belongingness!

***Challenges**

A few challenges that I have faced in working in open science are:

* Sometimes, due to the nature of the project, the work is completely voluntary which leads to a lack of motivation to work for a lot of people due to the lack of compensation, especially the ones who do not have the bandwidth to dedicate their time to free labour.
* Due to the same voluntary nature, there can sometimes be a lack of structure and accountability, since it is difficult to enforce strict guidelines for voluntary positions.
* In a collaboration, different people might have different working styles and approaches to solving a problem. It can be a challenge to navigate everything together while making sure no perspective is neglected.
* Picking up old projects without updated documentation and support can be challenging, especially for newcomers.

***Learning**

My learning goals in the Open Life Science program are as follows:

* Learn about the various Open Science principles and apply them successfully to projects and communities.
* Extend the understanding of Open Science principles beyond the program and reap its benefits in other projects too.
* Engage and learn from various members of the RSE communities across the world.
* Learn how to establish accessible, safe and healthy communities in Open Science.
* Learn how to apply ideas and concepts from peers in the program and make the best of open science collaborations.
* Learn how to accommodate different perspectives and working styles of different people in a collaboration effectively.
* Learn how to develop the governing and conduct policies for an open science project.

***Mentor**

My expectations from a mentor are as follows:

* **Tools and Technologies**
    * My primary programming language is Python, so it'd be helpful for the mentor to have Python experience.
    * The project would be most likely developed in the form of a website, so web development experience would be helpful too.
    * Although, I am open to learning new languages and technologies as well if they prove to be a better choice for the project!
* **Background**
    * Since the project aims to develop resources for the RSE community, it would be great if the mentor themselves are an RSE or have a similar experience!

These expectations are of course flexible. I'd be happy to collaborate and learn from my mentor(s) throughout the program and if possible, beyond it too!
